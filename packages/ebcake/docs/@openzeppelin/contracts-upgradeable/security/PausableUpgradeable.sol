## PausableUpgradeable

_Contract module which allows children to implement an emergency stop
mechanism that can be triggered by an authorized account.

This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the
modifiers &#x60;whenNotPaused&#x60; and &#x60;whenPaused&#x60;, which can be applied to
the functions of your contract. Note that they will not be pausable by
simply including this module, only once the modifiers are put in place._

### Paused

```solidity
event Paused(address account)
```

_Emitted when the pause is triggered by &#x60;account&#x60;._

### Unpaused

```solidity
event Unpaused(address account)
```

_Emitted when the pause is lifted by &#x60;account&#x60;._

### _paused

```solidity
bool _paused
```

### __Pausable_init

```solidity
function __Pausable_init() internal
```

_Initializes the contract in unpaused state._

### __Pausable_init_unchained

```solidity
function __Pausable_init_unchained() internal
```

### paused

```solidity
function paused() public view virtual returns (bool)
```

_Returns true if the contract is paused, and false otherwise._

### whenNotPaused

```solidity
modifier whenNotPaused()
```

_Modifier to make a function callable only when the contract is not paused.

Requirements:

- The contract must not be paused._

### whenPaused

```solidity
modifier whenPaused()
```

_Modifier to make a function callable only when the contract is paused.

Requirements:

- The contract must be paused._

### _pause

```solidity
function _pause() internal virtual
```

_Triggers stopped state.

Requirements:

- The contract must not be paused._

### _unpause

```solidity
function _unpause() internal virtual
```

_Returns to normal state.

Requirements:

- The contract must be paused._

### __gap

```solidity
uint256[49] __gap
```

_This empty reserved space is put in place to allow future versions to add new
variables without shifting down storage in the inheritance chain.
